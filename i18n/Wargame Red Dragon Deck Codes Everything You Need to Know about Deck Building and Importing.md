Wargame Red Dragon is a real-time strategy game that simulates modern warfare with a focus on realistic units and tactics. One of the most important aspects of the game is creating a deck, which is a customized selection of units that you can deploy in a battle. A good deck can give you an edge over your opponent, while a bad deck can limit your options and make you vulnerable.
 
There are many factors to consider when building a deck, such as the faction, the specialization, the availability, the cost, the role, and the synergy of the units. In this article, we will provide some general tips and examples of recommended decks for different scenarios and playstyles.

## Faction and Specialization
 
The first step in creating a deck is choosing a faction and a specialization. There are 17 factions in Wargame Red Dragon, divided into two blocs: NATO and PACT. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique units and bonuses. For example, USA has access to powerful air units and helicopters, while USSR has strong tanks and artillery.
 
Each faction can also choose a specialization, which is a sub-category that further narrows down the unit selection and gives additional bonuses. There are six specializations: Armored, Mechanized, Motorized, Airborne, Marine, and Support. Each specialization has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as different playstyles. For example, Armored decks have more tanks and heavy vehicles, while Airborne decks have more helicopters and planes.

The choice of faction and specialization depends on your personal preference, as well as the map, the game mode, and the enemy you are facing. Some factions and specializations are more suited for certain situations than others. For example, Marine decks are good for amphibious operations and coastal maps, while Mechanized decks are good for urban warfare and defensive positions.
  
## Availability and Cost
 
The next step in creating a deck is choosing the units that you want to include in your deck. Each unit has an availability and a cost value. Availability is the number of units that you can deploy in a battle, while cost is the amount of points that you need to spend to deploy a unit.
 
Availability and cost are inversely proportional: the more powerful or rare a unit is, the less availability and higher cost it has. For example, a superheavy tank like the M1A2 Abrams has low availability (2) and high cost (170), while an infantry squad like the Riflemen '90 has high availability (24) and low cost (15).
 
You have a limited number of activation points to spend on your deck, which determines how many units you can include in your deck. You also have a limited number of deployment points to spend on each battle, which determines how many units you can deploy at once. Therefore, you need to balance your deck between quantity and quality: having too many cheap units can make your deck inefficient and vulnerable to high-end units, while having too few expensive units can make your deck inflexible and unable to cover multiple fronts.
  
## Role and Synergy
 
The final step in creating a deck is choosing the role and synergy of your units. Each unit has a role that defines its main function and purpose on the battlefield. There are six main roles: Reconnaissance (Recon), Infantry (Inf), Support (Sup), Tank (TNK), Vehicle (VHC), Helicopter (HEL), Plane (PLN). Each role has its own sub-roles that further specify its capabilities and limitations. For example, Recon units can be divided into stealthy scouts or combat recon; Infantry units can be divided into shock troops or anti-tank teams; Support units can be divided into anti-air or artillery; Tank units can be divided into main battle tanks or fire support vehicles; Vehicle units can be divided into transports or anti-infantry; Helicopter units can be divided into gunships or transport; Plane units can be divided into bombers or fighters.
 
You need to have a balanced mix of roles in your deck to cover all aspects of warfare: Recon units provide vision and intelligence; Infantry units capture and hold key points; Support units provide fire support and air defense; Tank units provide mobility and firepower; Vehicle
